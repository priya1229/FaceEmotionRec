Project Title: Face Emotion Recognition using CNN

Description:

This project aims to build a deep learning model for recognizing facial emotions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model will be trained on the Kaggle "Facial Expression Recognition Challenge" dataset, which consists of images of faces labeled with one of seven emotions: angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, and neutral.

Key Components:

1. Dataset: Utilize the Kaggle "Facial Expression Recognition Challenge" dataset, which contains a large number of grayscale images of faces labeled with corresponding emotions.

2. Preprocessing: Preprocess the images to ensure uniform size, grayscale conversion, and normalization to improve the training process.

3. Model Architecture: Design and implement a CNN architecture suitable for the task of facial emotion recognition. Experiment with different architectures, such as variations of Convolutional, Pooling, and Fully Connected layers.

4. Training: Train the CNN model on the preprocessed dataset using appropriate training techniques, such as data augmentation, to improve generalization and performance.

5. Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on a separate validation dataset to assess its performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each emotion category.

6. Deployment: Provide instructions for deploying the trained model in real-world applications, such as web or mobile applications, using frameworks like TensorFlow.js or TensorFlow Lite.
